# Values
Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. Everything’s harder when we all believe different things about what's important to us as a team:

**Be Straightforward**. Whenever we speak - internally or externally - we should speak plainly and clearly. Watch out for lingo, assumptions, exaggeration, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesn’t mean we strip the poetry and personal expression from our language, but it’s got to make sense. With the exception of deep technical discussions, anyone who reads what we collectively write should simply get it without further explanation required. Don’t use eight words when five will do.

**Be a problem solver**. When an issue is found and is reported, try to go the extra mile attach a proposal for change or a plan of action. It doesn't need to be super elaborated, but it gives a different perspective from "complainer" to "solver".

**Be okay with failing. Focus on solutions, not blame.**. Don't be afraid of trying things out. And be okay letting go if it doesn't fly. When issues arise, focus on helping each other get to a better place and not on distributing blame.

**Be a team player**. Share what you know. Learn from others. Be open to new ideas. Be respectful and considerate.

**Be a good scout**. “Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.” It doesn't matter who made the mess.

**Be fair and do the right thing**. What’s fair? What’s the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyone’s judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is “what would you do for a friend or a neighbor if they asked for help?” An example might be providing a refund even if it’s a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who says ’Sure we can do that for you’ when a customer expected you to say ’sorry, we can’t.’ If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If that’s the case, don’t feel badly about it.

**Levelheadedness**. We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large. We don’t act out of spite, we don’t rush to judgment, we don’t jump to conclusions. If someone disagrees with us or attacks us we listen, we think, and we respond calmly and clearly - directly addressing the idea or the situation, not the personality or the pressure.

**Generosity**. Generosity is a wonderful virtue. Being generous is surprising someone on the other end with goodwill and asking for nothing in return. It could be time, attention, or treasure - we give what we’re expected to, and then some.

**Independence**. This one’s a bit of a contradiction. After speaking about shared values, here’s one that breaks away: Independence. We encourage independent thought and original thinking.

**Innovation and improvement**. We should keep an eye for innovation on new features as well as evolving current ones. We should be on the lookout for improvements in different aspects of our work: in how we treat and help each other, in the code base, in the processes we follow, in our own craft...

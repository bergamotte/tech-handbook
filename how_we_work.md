# How we work

## Cycles
We work in development cycles that last around 3-4 weeks.
At the end of each cycle we have a cooldown period that we take to reflect on what we have accomplished, fix and polish small changes to what was released that went thru the cracks.

Any given week (read frequently), Product and Project Manager, CTO and Principal Developer meet to draft and prioritize what we should take on the next cycle with the help of team members and stakeholders.

When we are close to finishing the current cycle, the next cycle has already been defined and is ready to start when we decide to do so.

## Functional Domain Experts?
Since we take a wide array of projects and sub-systems, it is increasingly difficult for any one person to keep in their head all the details.
We instead promote the figure of the Domain Expert. This person is the go-to answer finder (might not now, but will figure out) in relation to the details of a particular functional domain. For example: what are the rules for sending Subscription automated emails?

Functional domain experts oversee the well being of the tech documentation and troubleshooting techniques about particular domains. They collaborate with members to develop changes to their respective domains to ensure documentation is updated and the functionality is good to go.

This expertise is not technical and doesn't represent rank, only functional knowledge. Although organically, the technical intricacies will be in their head and their technical opinion is highly valued.

## Company-critical developments
There are parts of the system more critical than others for the company. For instance,
- If there is an issue regarding payments, we are losing money.
- If there is an issue on workshop processing apps, our workshop colleagues cannot continue working.
Around big days, these parts of the system are specially stressed under heavy load.

That doesn't mean that only a selected few should touch them. We want to collaborate an broaden knowledge and capability. But keep in mind the risks associated with them and pay extra care.

The Principal developer and at least a Senior developer need to review any significant change to these parts of the system.

## Our relationship with the calendar year
Being in the intersection between flowers, plants and gardening business, the calendar year impacts our work to a great extent.

Gifting dates are critical to us:
- Christmas
- Valentine's day
- Mother's day
- Grand Mother's day

Spring season in also relevant to us in relation with plants and gardening.

Sales start about 2 weeks before a big date. Any development with high impact needs to be ready before then.

Pop-up season and retail events.

This translates to us being very busy between December and June and a bit calmer the other half of the year (June to December).

## How features and tasks are added to the board
PM works with the different departments as well as the CTO and Principal Engineer to draft feature proposals for the next cycle.
Domain experts and UX/UI/Design people help the above people in shaping the drafts into executable items.

We don't like to micromanage and want every member of the team to get involved in feature development early on. Expect to be called into the process of feature definition regardless of your role.

Even though we sometimes get into ambitious projects that expand many weeks and could be seen from a high level as a single feature, we'll iterate over it in different cycles breaking it down to smaller deliverables that provide value on themselves.

## How features get done
We create feature teams of 2-3 people at the beginning of a cycle.
The team will divide the feature into smaller tasks and the related functional domain expert will review the job.
With the intention to promote collaboration and cross-learning, people rotate developing features related to different domains. The only constant is the involvement of the domain expert in the definition and validation phases. But that domain expert may very well be working on a different domain this cycle.

Features considered mission critical will be overseen closely by the principal developer and at least a senior developer. Special care should be given for these important parts of the system regarding: understandability, scalability and performance.

A feature is only considered DONE after green light from PM and related stakeholder (ie. marketing, customer service).

## Tech support and rotations
Each developer takes their turn (1 week each) to do a Production Support rotation, this entails providing support to the rest of the company (via the Slack support channels) and spending time working on aspects of the app that you would not usually interact with by working on other projects/fixing bugs/investigating problems or potential new technologies.

# Bergamotte Tech Engineering Handbook

This handbook reflects how we work and what we care about within the Tech Engineering team of Bergamotte. It is a collaborative, open and evolving project. Please do contribute to keep it current and honest about our practices and beliefs.

If you are thinking about joining our team, it will help you get a sense of how we work.

If you are new to the team, please help us keep this handbook current, as you'll be experiencing first hand any deviation between what we say we do and what we actually do :)

If you have been a member of the team for a couple of months, an honest review of any aspect of this handbook and proposals for change are more than welcome <3

This handbook is just an overview. Internal detailed documentation will provide further information.

# Hiring process

Thanks for your interest in becoming a part of our Engineering Team! You'll be able to find more information about us in the different documents on this repo. We hope you find them helpful to get a better sense of how we work.

Regarding our hiring process, here are the steps that will commonly take place:
1. Non-technical phone call interview with a member of HR (30 minutes).
2. We'll send instructions to join a repo containing instructions to complete an exercise in the form of pull requests. Our expectation is that no more than 4 hours should be dedicated to it. There is no rush in our side for this step to be completed. Just give us an approximation for us to plan time for next steps.
3. Once you are finished, reply to the email to tell us that we can start reviewing the exercise.
4. Some members of the tech team will review the exercise and gather feedback.
5. No more than 4 days after your submission, we'll schedule a call with our principal engineer to share feedback about your submission simulating a peer review. This will give us a chance to go deeper into technical questions in the context of that piece of work. (1 hour)
6. You'll have a call with a senior member of our tech team to get to know each other a bit better and help both ends gather feedback for team fit. (30 min)
7. Between 1 and 3 days later we'll arrange a call with our CTO (30 min)
8. A formal offer will be provided shortly after.

In normal circumstances, we expect the process to take about 2 weeks from start to finish.

We are aware that recruitment processes can be stressful and there can be a lot of uncertainties. We'll do our best to provide a good experience:
- Being open about our ways of working. An example of that is this public repository.
- Being clear about our process and expected timings.
- Providing timely responses if, at any point in our process, we decide that it won't work out for us.
- Understanding potential scheduling issues or time constraints and trying to accommodate.

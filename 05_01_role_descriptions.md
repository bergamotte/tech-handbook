# Role descriptions for developers

We use the following criteria to assess the level and title of developers at Bergamotte. These criteria aren’t exhaustive, and they aren’t mere checklists. They’re a guidance to having an individualized discussion about career progression.

Look at levels as a progression in mastery and responsibilities. When interested in career advancement, use them as a compass about what to focus next and looking for opportunities to apply it. It is expected that as someone progresses through the levels, it has a good grasp on the focus skills of previous levels. But the focus is different for every role.
We are all humans after all, and we all have bad days and can fall to some anti-pattern. It is okay to not be perfect. What counts is the improvements we make over time.

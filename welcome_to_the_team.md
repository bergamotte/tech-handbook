# Welcome to the team!

We are so excited to have you here! We are glad that you trusted us to continue your development career. We have so much to learn from each other.

As a newcomer, your perspective from a pair of fresh eyes is very valuable to us in all aspects of the company. We are curious too! Please:
- Help us review your interview process to help us improve it.
- Open PRs to update any documentation that you find needs some love or is inaccurate.
- When you first interact with the UI of any of our systems, create an issue if you found some workflow odd to follow and have some improvement idea. Email the Product Manager with a link to the issue.

## Where to find help
Get yourself familiar with our internal documentation system. You'll find there general information about the different departments.

To know more about the terms we use and our sub-systems, check out the internal documentation engineering section.

You have already met some of the team members during the hiring process.

## The onboarding process
### Before you start
We'll be ready with all the different accounts and authorizations setup for the day you arrive.
You'll be assigned a "buddy" that will help you land on your feet from the start. This will be your go-to person if you find yourself stuck for any reason and will check-in with you from time to time.

### Your first day
We'll do a meetup with the tech team and introduce ourselves.
You'll have a 1 on 1 with your buddy to say hi and get you started.
You'll be invited to the different slack channels where the tech team communicates between ourselves and with other departments.

Your buddy will help you finish your local setup.

You'll be tasked with some introductory development tasks that will serve as an excuse to make yourself familiar with some part of our system. There isn't an expectation for you to release to production on the first day (or the second for that matter). There is no need to put pressure there. You'll be releasing plenty in no time :)

### Your first week
You'll have 1 on 1s with some people in the tech team, specially: CTO, Product and Project Manager and Principal Developer.
You'll be contributing to development and releases and start participating in [how we work](how_we_work.md).

### Your first few weeks
You'll be working with different team members to start knowing each other better.
Your buddy will keep pinging you from time to time, at least twice a week.
The Principal developer will meet with you on 1 on 1s once a week. These are opportunities to be open about how are you feeling as a new member of the team and help you thrive in your new setting.
You'll be getting more familiar with our processes and the code base and will be progressively more autonomous.

### Half point of your trial period
The Principal developer will schedule a team fit meeting with you. Both will have the opportunity to review your first few months in the company.

### End of trial period
The Principal developer will schedule a second team fit meeting. Both will have the opportunity to review your first few months in the company and will consolidate your new position.
After this meeting, you'll follow the same 6 months performance review schedule (April and October).

## Show me the code already!
I know, I know :) You should be pretty excited about getting into the action.
You'll find instructions about how to setup your dev environment on the [Readme](https://github.com/bergamotte/bergamotte#readme) of the main repo. Please, ping your buddy if you get stuck for whatever reason.

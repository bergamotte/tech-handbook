## Moonlight managers
We do have dedicated Product Manager and Project Manager. But for the time being we have decided to not have full time managers.

Dedicating time to management is important. We expect everyone in the team to be involved in helping the team improve over those four areas of management to some degree. Everyone dedicates part of the time to managerial activities. Different people will have a different percentage of time dedicated to management.

This is greatly influenced by [Basecamp](https://m.signalvnoise.com/moonlighting-managers-aint-got-no-time-for-bullshit/).

Principal Developers, followed by Lead developers and so on, will dedicate a bigger percentage of their time to management, but it shouldn't be the majority of their time.

## Managers of 1
We believe everyone should be able to manage themselves. We value autonomy and problem solvers.
We value proactive people that both ask for help and raise awareness when they find an issue.
And we value people that look for ways to impact the company besides "current task work".
Try to follow [the boy scout rule](https://matheus.ro/2017/12/11/clean-code-boy-scout-rule/) in all aspects of your work, not only on the code base.

## Career advancement and well-being
Every 6 months we conduct performance and improvements reviews. We reflect on the past and define a path forward with attainable proposals.

Every 2 weeks we conduct 1 on 1 to review 6 months objectives, desires and needs and general well being.

Even though some people look forward to increase their responsibilities and impact within the company (and we'll provides ways to achieve it), some people might not be interested in switching roles and would prefer to deepen their skills for the current role. We support either choice and will define together a plan of improvement with opportunities to put it in practice.
